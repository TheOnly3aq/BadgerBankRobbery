# Main features:
- Different cooldown between Banks and Stores
- Different amounts between Banks and Stores
- Change the time it takes to rob a store per store


# TODO: 
- Make the robberySucces, robberyFailed, robberyStoreSuccess and robberyStoreFailed change when the cooldown variable changes, tried for an hour to get it to work, so if anyone can help me, please do lol.
